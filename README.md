### Technological and Professional Journey: 1988-Present

- **8086-based IBM Compatible PC and MS-DOS (1988):** My brother's personal computer, equipped with two 5.25" floppy drives, 640 KB of RAM, a green monochrome CRT monitor, and a keyboard, had no hard disk and no mouse. This setup was my gateway into the world of computing and coding. With the MS-DOS operating system, I learned the essentials of using command-line interfaces, navigating system directories, and utilizing various system utilities.

- **GW-BASIC (1988):** This intuitive programming language was my introduction to coding. It was like playing with Lego blocks, where each line of code was a building block towards creating something new and functional. Among my early projects were a minefield-like game and a basic animation featuring the "Ciao" mascot of the 1990 World Cup, animating a soccer ball, along with a substantial amount of experimental code. These early coding experiences were pivotal in sparking my interest in logical problem-solving and software development.

- **Turbo Pascal (1989):** This was my introduction to structured programming and the fundamentals of software design. Among my projects was a simple contacts application, which marked my first steps into understanding user inputs, data structures, and data persistence on disk.

- **Windows 3.1 (1991):** This shift represented a significant leap into the world of graphical user interfaces. I vividly remember the after-school sessions in my middle school's labs. There, our music teacher introduced us to using the computer, programming basic beeps in GW-BASIC, adjusting frequencies, durations, and pauses to match simple music sheets. These sessions were more than just about learning; they were about sharing and expanding knowledge. I embraced the opportunity to assist the teacher, helping my classmates understand the basics of programming. This experience not only enriched my skills but also deepened my appreciation for the collaborative nature of technology and its creative applications.

- **First Internet Connection (1995):** My initial experience with the Internet came through a dial-up service at a local library. Despite its limitations, this opened up a new realm of possibilities, including my early explorations into the vast world of the Internet and its online search engines, such as AltaVista and Yahoo. I remember searching for everything related to James Taylor.

- **Pentium, Windows 2000, and Home Dial-Up Internet (2000):** A significant upgrade in my technological journey was acquiring my first "modern" personal computer - a Pentium 4 with 256 MB of RAM, a 20 GB hard drive, and a 56K modem. This setup marked the beginning of my journey into home Internet access, greatly expanding my opportunities for learning and web exploration.

- **Text Editors and IDEs (2000-Present):** My journey with software development tools began with the simplicity of Windows Notepad. It was here that I learned the fundamentals of coding by directly interacting with plain text files. Soon after, I progressed to Microsoft FrontPage, which provided a more integrated environment to inspect HTML code and visually link the markup with its actual web page result. Over the years, my toolkit evolved to include more advanced editors and IDEs such as EditPlus, Macromedia Dreamweaver, and NetBeans, each offering enhanced features and a more sophisticated development experience. Later, I embraced Atom for its modern interface and open-source community. Currently, I use Visual Studio Code (VSCode), appreciating its versatility, extensive plugin ecosystem, and robust support for a wide range of programming languages and frameworks.

- **HTML, CSS and JavaScript (2000-Present):** My entry point into web development. I started crafting static web pages, incorporating basic styles and simple animation scripts. During this time, I undertook a project for my grandmother's hair salon, which became my first official web development job, without any charge of course.

- **Web Developer (2001-Present):** I was hired by a web agency, and my first day in the tech industry coincided with the events of September 11, 2001. I remember the overwhelming internet traffic and slow connectivity on that day vividly. My first role involved updating and fixing hundreds of static web pages for various businesses, including the Palermo Airport's website and those in the wine and travel sectors of Sicily. This experience taught me the value of teamwork, the intricacies of handling legacy code, and the importance of clean coding practices and thorough documentation. Working on these diverse projects not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the impact of external events on digital infrastructures.

- **VBScript, ASP3, and Microsoft Access (2002):** I transitioned to dynamic web development using VBScript and ASP3. This phase of my career enhanced the interactivity and responsiveness of the websites I worked on. I also began utilizing Microsoft Access as a database management system for web applications, broadening my skills in server-side scripting and database management.

- **PHP and MySQL (2003-2018):** During this period, I developed various sophisticated, data-driven web applications. This included a notable web application for standardizing the diagnosis of Celiac Disease, which was my first project intended for a worldwide audience. This marked a significant milestone in my professional journey, expanding my reach and impact in the field of web development.

- **JavaScript as OOP and Ajax (2004-2008):** During this period, I delved deeper into JavaScript, exploring its object-oriented programming (OOP) features and the use of Ajax. I undertook a small library project that utilized JavaScript‚Äôs OOP capabilities and incorporated Ajax for more dynamic web interactions. Although modest compared to libraries like Prototype.js and later jQuery, this project was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of how JavaScript could be used for more sophisticated web development tasks. By integrating OOP principles and Ajax with JavaScript, I significantly improved the organization, reusability, and scalability of my code. This marked a key turning point in my JavaScript utilization, enabling me to develop web interfaces that were both sophisticated and efficient, greatly improving user interactions and application performance.

- **Technical Writer, FP Analyst, and PM Assistant (2004-2005):** In this year, I diversified my professional experiences by taking on roles as a technical writer, Function Points (FP) analyst, and project manager assistant in the Telecommunications sector. These roles deepened my understanding of the entire software engineering lifecycle.

- **Biotech and Manufacturing Execution Systems (2006-2012):** During this period, I was involved in designing an ISO 13485 compliant Manufacturing Execution System (MES) for a biotech company. This project required me to navigate both the technical and regulatory aspects of the biotech sector, integrating my software development skills with the specific needs of the industry.

- **IT Administrator, System Integrator, and Technical Specialist (2008-2014):** My roles during these years included responsibilities in IT administration, system integration, and providing technical support. This experience enhanced my understanding of comprehensive IT infrastructure and the integration of various technologies within it.

- **Unix-like Operating Systems (2009-Present):** I began working with other operating systems during this time, specifically Ubuntu Server (used both as a local and hosting platform) and macOS (as both a personal and professional working environment).

- **Web Application Frameworks (2013-Present):** I started developing my own web application frameworks, enabling the creation of more efficient and scalable web applications. This includes a project for a biodiversity data bank, where I was able to modularize the code and create dynamic custom features and datasets.

- **Co-founder of a Startup (2014-2019):** I co-founded a startup, focusing primarily on the technological innovation and development aspects of the business. My role involved extensive research and application of cutting-edge technologies, driving the technical vision of the company. I dedicated myself to developing robust and scalable software solutions, ensuring they aligned with our strategic goals. This period was marked by significant technical growth and learning, as I navigated the challenges of bringing novel ideas to fruition in a dynamic startup environment. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the practical applications of emerging technologies in a real-world setting.
