### Technological and Professional Journey: 1988-Present

- **8086-based IBM Compatible PC and MS-DOS (1988):** My brother's personal computer, equipped with two 5.25" floppy drives, 640 KB of RAM, a green monochrome CRT monitor, and a keyboard, had no hard disk and no mouse. This setup was my gateway into the world of computing and coding. With the MS-DOS operating system, I learned the essentials of using command-line interfaces, navigating system directories, and utilizing various system utilities.

- **GW-BASIC (1988):** This intuitive programming language was my introduction to coding. It was like playing with Lego blocks, where each line of code was a building block towards creating something new and functional. Among my early projects were a minefield-like game and a basic animation featuring the "Ciao" mascot of the 1990 World Cup, animating a soccer ball, along with a substantial amount of experimental code. These early coding experiences were pivotal in sparking my interest in logical problem-solving and software development.

- **Turbo Pascal (1989):** This was my introduction to structured programming and the fundamentals of software design. Among my projects was a simple contacts application, which marked my first steps into understanding user inputs, data structures, and data persistence on disk.

These sessions were more than just about learning; they were about sharing and expanding knowledge. I embraced the opportunity to assist the teacher, helping my classmates understand the basics of programming. This experience not only enriched my skills but also deepened my appreciation for the collaborative nature of technology and its creative applications.

- **First Internet Connection (1995):** My initial experience with the Internet came through a dial-up service at a local library. Despite its limitations, this opened up a new realm of possibilities, including my early explorations into the vast world of the Internet and its online search engines, such as AltaVista and Yahoo. I remember searching for everything related to James Taylor.

- **Pentium, Windows 2000, and Home Dial-Up Internet (2000):** A significant upgrade in my technological journey was acquiring my first "modern" personal computer - a Pentium 4 with 256 MB of RAM, a 20 GB hard drive, and a 56K modem. This setup marked the beginning of my journey into home Internet access, greatly expanding my opportunities for learning and web exploration.

- **Text Editors and IDEs (2000-Present):** My journey with software development tools began with the simplicity of Windows Notepad.
